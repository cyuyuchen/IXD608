          The girl has a tattoo of a heart on her left arm. The girl also has stitches all over her body convey- ing the idea that she is broken inside. Also on the table you see a glass of wine and a wine bottle with a symbol on it representing poison or death. Now what does that tattoo represent. It may rep- resent love, or lack of it. So is this girl broken inside because she is in love, or because she has not found love. Furthermore why is she trying to do harm to herself when she is already feeling so much pain. Does the wine make her feel happy temporarily, or does it make her feel worse. The look on her face would make you believe that she does not seem happy. So maybe she has lost all hope, and that is why she is killing herself by drink- ing wine. Maybe she is already so broken inside that she feels impervious to pain. Or she could be feeling so much pain that she wants it all to come to an end!?
